## Goal Achievement Status

✅ Short-term goal (increase overall coverage to 85%): Exceeded, achieved 94%
✅ Medium-term goal (increase overall coverage to 90%): Exceeded, achieved 94%
⏳ Long-term goal (increase overall coverage to above 95%): Nearly complete, 94%, only 1% more needed

## Summary

By systematically adding tests for uncovered code, we have significantly improved the test coverage of FastMCP-Factory. The focus areas of factory.py and server.py have reached coverage levels of 98% and 94% respectively, significantly exceeding the initial targets. These improvements not only enhance code quality and stability but also provide a reliable testing foundation for future feature development and maintenance.
